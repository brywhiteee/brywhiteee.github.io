  	<h1>Week One Assignment</h1>
    <h2>Long Live The Web</h2>
  	   <p style="font-size: 20px; color: #A9DFBF"> While reading this article it is interesting to learn about the brief history of the mechanics of the web all while getting into the nitty-gritty about human consumption. It is quite amazing to see what internet access has blossomed into, and how it is now a “web” of knowledge, entertainment, as well as controversy due to government involvement. The web has become a gateway for anyone to access, young or old, and with such vast access, we can successfully communicate around the globe. </p>

  	   <p style="font-size: 20px; color: #A9DFBF"> This way of communicating is especially helpful for the government and its citizens. It helps to keep up with what is happening outside our borders, and it spreads potentially life threatening information. This article is successful in showing the creative uprise and downfalls of too much or too little internet access, as well as how certain decisions would help better or worsen our societies. </p>

  	<h2>As We May Think</h2>
  	  <p style="font-size: 20px; color: #A9DFBF"> This article talks greatly about the importance of advancement, and how those achievements are beneficial to the mediums that we take for granted in our modern day. For example, the author talks about photography and how something so clunky with a long development period for photos is easily accessible. For myself, I can appreciate the efforts that scientists and artists have taken in order for us to be able to type our assignments on a laptop, take videos on our phones, and have a compacted way to listen to music and access videos. For as long as scientists are able to improve upon and develop more technologies, I do not believe there will ever be a shortage of advancements. </p>
