             <center><p> For predominantly black and brown folk, Hip-Hop was about community and being able to occupy a space that gives room for the exploration of sound and music. </p></center>
             
            <br>

             <p> By having the right space, artists and those in the area were able to have a creative environment to produce music and expand the Hip-Hop genre to what we know of it today.</p>

            <div class="box3">

             <p> A space created by the users of Hip-Hop (black and brown folk) is critical because it provides a place to practice a medium that has a heavy emphasis on community. </p>

             <br>

             <p> Wilkins proposes a plan for a park that can provide cultural and communal use in a space that is deemed “pleasurable” and “desirable”. This is important because in many urban spaces community maintenance is neglected since that area is underfunded by the state. </p>
